+++ How JS works and Execution Context +++

--> Everything in JS happens insinde an Execution Context

--> Execution Context has 2 components
+ Code Component --> Thread of Execution --> Executes the code
+ Memory Component --> Variable Environment --> Managing memory

--> Memory Component stores data as key-value pair
+ Primitive types --> Stored dicrectly
+ Reference types --> Stored in Heap and is pointed in Memory Component

--> JavaScript --> Synchronous and Single-threaded language
--> JavaScript executes one thing at a time and in a specific order

+++ How JS code is executed & Call Stack +++

--> Creation Context
--> Memory Creation Phase
+ Variable: undefined
+ Funtion: Store whole function
--> Excecution phase
+ Function is invoked --> new Execution Context is created

--> Handle Execution Contexts
--> Call Stack

--> Call Stack maintains the order of execution of Execution Contexts
