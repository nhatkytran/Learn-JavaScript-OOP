+++ Asynchronous JavaScript, AJAX and APIs +++

--> Synchronous --> Blocking code
+ Code is executed line by line
+ Each line of code waits for previous line to finish

--> Asynchronous --> None-blocking code
+ Code is executed after a task that runs in the "background" finishes

---
const image = document.querySelector('.dog');

image.addEventListener('load', function() {
  this.classList.add('fadeIn');
});

image.addEventListener('error', function() {
  console.error('Something went wrong loading image!');
  console.error(error);
});

image.src = 'dog.jpg';

--> AJAX --> Asynchronous JavaScript and XML --> Communicate with remote \
web servers in an asynchronous way
--> AJAX calls --> Request data from web servers dynamically

--> API --> Application Programming Interface
+ Piece of software used by another piece of software --> allow applications \
to talk to each other
+ Many types of APIs in Web development: DOM API, own class API, "Online" API,...
--> "Online" APIs --> Application running on a server --> receives \
requests for data, and sends data back as response
+ 3rd-party APIs

--> AJAX --> XML data format
--> JSON data format

+++ Asynchronous Behind The Scenes: The Event Loop +++

--> Event Loop --> Imagine it as While (true) {} but more efficient
--> Each iteration is Event Loop tick

--> Call back Starvation --> Microtasks queue --> Callback queue
