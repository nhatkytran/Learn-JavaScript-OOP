+++ JavaScript +++

--> JavaScript is a high-level, object-oriented, multi-paradigm programming language

--> A multi-paradigm programming language is a language that supports multiple programming \
paradigms or styles. Programming paradigms refer to the different approaches to writing \
software programs
--> For example, some programming paradigms are:

+ Procedural: focuses on writing a sequence of procedures or functions that perform specific tasks
+ Object-oriented: focuses on creating and manipulating objects that contain data and behavior
+ Functional: focuses on writing functions that take inputs and produce outputs without modifying \
any data outside the function
+ Declarative: focuses on specifying what the program should do, rather than how to do it

--> A multi-paradigm programming language combines two or more of these programming paradigms, often \
allowing developers to choose the most appropriate approach for a specific task or problem
--> JavaScript is an example of a multi-paradigm programming language. It supports object-oriented \
programming, functional programming, and even some declarative paradigms, among others. This flexibility \
and versatility make it a popular choice for a wide range of web development and software engineering applications

--> In summary, we can say that JavaScript is multi-paradigm programming language: OOP, Functional, Declarative

--> Declarative v/s Imperative? Such as Fetching API

--> More about Functional Programming
--> Programming paradigm
+ Funtions are first-class citizens --> passed as arguments, can be returned from function, stored in variable
+ Pure function --> Don't mutate data, same input same output
+ Emphasizes declarative programming

--> Every thing in JS is an object --> Prototype-based Object-Oriented Programming --> Object Constructor and its prototype

--> Primitive Types --> There are 6 Primitive Types --> undefined, null, number, string, boolean, symbol
--> Actually called "Primitive" because they are not object and do not have any properties or methods
--> Why 'string'.toLowerCase()?
--> We can use properties and methods with Primitive values because JavaScript provides object wrappers for each \
Primitive types (Number, String, Boolean)
--> 123.__proto__ --> SyntaxError
--> Number(123).__proto__
--> Passed by value --> when a value is assigned to a variable, a copy of the value is created, instead of just a reference \
to the original value

--> Perference Types --> Object (Regular Object), Array, Function,...
--> Pass by reference

+ High Level
+ Garbage Collected
+ Interpreted
+ Multi-paradigm

+ Just-in-time Compiled
- JavaScript is indeed Just-In-Time (JIT) compiled. This means that the JavaScript code is not compiled ahead of time, \
but rather compiled just before it is executed. The JavaScript engine takes the source code and converts it into machine code, \
which can then be run by the CPU. JIT compilation has the advantage of allowing for faster code execution because it can optimize \
the machine code based on the specific runtime environment and current execution context.

+ Prototype-based Object-Oriented
+ Non-blocking Event Loop Concurrency Model

+ First-class Funciton
- Functions are treated like any other variable
- A function can be passed as an argument to other functions, can be returned by another function and can be assigned as a value to a variable.

+ Dynamic
+ Single-threaded --> JS is single-threaded itself, but its environment is not --> Web APIs environment
