+++ How JS works and Execution Context +++

--> Everything in JS happens insinde an Execution Context

--> Execution Context has 2 components
+ Code Component --> Thread of Execution --> Executes the code
+ Memory Component --> Variable Environment --> Managing memory

--> Memory Component stores data as key-value pair
+ Primitive types --> Stored dicrectly
+ Reference types --> Stored in Heap and is pointed in Memory Component

--> JavaScript --> Synchronous and Single-threaded language
--> JavaScript executes one thing at a time and in a specific order
